First, download and build v8:

http://code.google.com/apis/v8/build.html

If you want to build v8 with GCC 4.x at x64 platform, you should compile v8 with PIC (Position-Independent Code) mode, and set the arch to x64 for scons.

export CCFLAGS=-fPIC
scons arch=x64

To build jav8:

$ export V8_HOME=<v8_path>
$ ant
